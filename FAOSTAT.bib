@article{Pickering2014,
abstract = {Universities increasingly expect students to publish during a PhD candidature because it benefits the candidate, supervisor, institution, and wider community. Here, we describe a method successfully used by early-career researchers including PhD candidates to undertake and publish literature reviews - a challenge for researchers new to a field. Our method allows researchers new to a field to systematically analyse existing academic literature to produce a structured quantitative summary of the field. This method is a more straightforward and systematic approach than the traditional 'narrative method' common to many student theses. When published, this type of review can also complement existing narrative reviews produced by experts in a field by quantitatively assessing the literature, including identifying research gaps. The method can also be used as the initial step for further analysis, including identifying suitable datasets for meta-analysis. Students report that the method is enabling and rewarding. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} 2013 HERDSA.},

@article{Wu2023,
abstract = {Collecting structured data from Web APIs, such as the Twitter API, Yelp Fusion API, Spotify API, and DBLP API, is a common task in the data science lifecycle, but it requires advanced programming skills for data scientists. To simplify web data collection and lower the barrier to entry, API wrappers have been developed to wrap API calls into easy-to-use functions. However, existing API wrappers are not standardized, which means that users must download and maintain multiple API wrappers and learn how to use each of them, while developers must spend considerable time creating an API wrapper for any new website. In this demo, we present the Web Connector, which unifies API wrappers to overcome these limitations. First, the Web Connector has an easy-to-use program-ming interface, designed to provide a user experience similar to that of reading data from relational databases. Second, the Web Connector's novel system architecture requires minimal effort to fetch data for end-users with an existing API description file. Third, the Web Connector includes a semi-automatic API description file generator that leverages the concept of generation by example to create new API wrappers without writing code.},

This rather unlikely linguistic cocktail would probably never have been prepared by computer scientists, yet the language has become surprisingly popular. With millions of lines of R code available in repositories, we have an opportunity to evaluate the fundamental choices underlying the R language design. Using a combination of static and dynamic program analysis we assess the success of different language features.},

@misc{FAO2023,
abstract = {Global trade in agricultural and food products has grown rapidly in recent decades, with countries becoming more engaged in this trade, whether as exporters or importers. This trend is expected to continue over the coming decades. As a consequence, trade will play an increasingly important role in influencing the extent and nature of food security across all regions of the globe. The challenge has therefore become one of ensuring that the expansion of agricultural trade works for, and not against, the elimination of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. This edition of The State of Agricultural Commodity Markets aims to reduce the current polarization of views on the impacts of agricultural trade on food security and on the manner in which agricultural trade should be governed to ensure that increased trade openness is beneficial to all countries. By providing evidence and clarity on a range of topics, the report seeks to contribute to a more informed debate on policy choices and to identify required improvements in the policy processes within which these choices are made.},
